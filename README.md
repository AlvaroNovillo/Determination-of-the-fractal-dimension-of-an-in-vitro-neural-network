# Determination-of-the-fractal-dimension-of-an-in-vitro-neural-network
Characterization of the fractal dimension of self-organized CNNs in time and space. To do so, we extend the concept of correlation dimension of complex systems to a spatial neural network using random walker trayectories that explores the red and creates a temporal series
