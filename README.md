# Determination of the fractal dimension of an in-vitro neural network
In this project, we will inspect the evolution of cultured living neurons. The neurons has been cultured in the research group lead by Inmaculada Leyva and Irene Sendiña from the Rey Juan Carlos University.  Starting as collections of separated cells without structure, the neurons will self-organized themselves into elaborated, clustered, networks. By means of an image processing tool, we will extract the adjacency matrix of the culture for each day  in vitro (DIV). Then, we will characterize the evolution of the main characteristics of the network during the self-organization process by the analysis of a group of topological and geometrical parameters. Specifically, in this project, we will be focusing on the characterization of the fractal dimension of these complex networks. To do so, we will generalize the concept of correlation dimension of dynamical systems to spatially embedded networks, as proposed in Lacasa et al. Thus, by means of a random walker surfing the network, we will be able to extract the intrinsic dimension of the network through its maturation process. Our results characterize its dimensionality, giving more relevant information about the  small-network state found in previous work at the final stages of the development.
